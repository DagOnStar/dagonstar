Weather Research and Forecastisting Model (WRF)

The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model is a state of the art mesoscale numerical weather prediction system
designed for both atmospheric research and operational forecasting applications. It features two dynamical cores, a
data assimilation system, and a software architecture supporting parallel computation and system extensibility [continue](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/models/wrf)...
